**imgs.ai** is a fast, dataset-agnostic, deep visual search engine for digital art history based on neural network embeddings. It utilizes modern approximate k-NN algorithms via [Spotify's Annoy library](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) to deliver fast search results even for very large datasets in low-resource environments, and integrates the [OpenAI CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) model for text-based visual search. Try it on a host of [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) collections or [sign up](/signup) for an account to access more functions/datasets (institutional email address and approval required.) In total, close to **2.5 million images** have been indexed so far, with new datasets added regularly. imgs.ai is a non-profit, experimental research platform and commercial use is not allowed.

imgs.ai is developed by [Fabian Offert](https://zentralwerkstatt.org) with contributions by Peter Bell and Oleg Harlamov. Get in touch at [hi@imgs.ai](mailto:hi@imgs.ai).
